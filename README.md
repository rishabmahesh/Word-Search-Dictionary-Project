# Word-Search-Dictionary-Project

About:
This is a mini python project which uses a JSON database to get the meaning of words, and find similar words if a word is not found. It also uses the Oxford Dictionary API to get meanings, and examples in the form of sentences using the word.

References:
Code inspired from the Oxford Dictionary API Documentation which can be found at https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation/

Skills Learned: 
Extensively researched how to use APIs, and finding the right ones that can be implemented easily. Learned how to use the json features in python. Dealed with error codes from the Oxford Dictionary servers, and debugging to perfect program output.
